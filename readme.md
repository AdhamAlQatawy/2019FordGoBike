## Dataset

> The data set is called Fordgobike, This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area, and represents trips taken by members of the service for month of February of 2019
> in this dataset there were more than one issue. There were outliers, null values, and data types that needed to be changed. 
> I used python and it's libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to analyse and visualize the data.


## Summary of Findings

> the average age of riders is between 25 to 40 years old
> most trips take from 2 minutes to 12 minutes
> most trips happened during work days
> most common hours the people ride bikes in are 8am and 5pm
> the most riders are subscribers
> males riders are more than females
> From the age 20 to the age 40 the trips duartion is between 2 minutes to 40 minutes and it decreases by the increase in age
> that the age of the subscribers is more than the age of the customers.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> the duration per minutes are skewed with a long range, so I changed the range to be clear.
> The relation between the Age and the Duration per minute was skewed, so I changed the duration scale to log scale to be clear to see and get insight.
> The relation between the Age and the Duration per minute per user type wasn't that clear to find the difference, so I seperated each user type to its own chart to better see the difference.
